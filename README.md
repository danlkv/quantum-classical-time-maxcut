## Time advantage in QAOA MaxCut over classical solutions


### Directory structure

The general approach is to have data an presentation layers separate Ã -la MVC pattern.

* `data/*.nc` - data files
* `data/generators/` - scripts that generate the data 
* `plots/*.ipynb` - scripts that generate figures
* `plots/pdf/` - pdf output from figure generators


### Nice tools used

You'll need these to fully understand the code

* [QTensor](https://github.com/danlkv/qtensor) - tensor network simulator with focus on MaxCut
* [Cartesian Explorer](https://github.com/danlkv/cartesian-explorer/) - a handy tool to map multi-dimensional data
* [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) - used to store datasets with their coordinates in [netcdf format](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/getting-started-guide/quick-overview.html?highlight=netcdf#read-write-netcdf-files)
* [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) and [gurobipy](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/) - classical optimization of combinatorial problems.


#### Gurobi installation
See instructions on the official site, the general steps are the following:

1. Register at the website [gurobi.com](https://www.gurobi.com)
2. Unpack an archive 
3. Run licensing code (included in `data/generators/*`)



### Reproducibility

All the figures in the paper are generated by notebooks in this repository.

- Figure 3: `plots/Longrange correlations [figure 3].ipynb`
- Figure 4: `plots/Time bounds [figure4].ipynb`
- Figures 5 and 6: `plots/Quantum match gurobi time [figure5, 6].ipynb`
- Figure 7: `plots/Match quality multi-shot QAOA[figure 7].ipynb`
- Figure 8: `plots/Cost variance vs N [figure8].ipynb`


data in `data/xarray_0.19.0` were obtained using an older version of `xarray`.It was converted to json which was then converted to json and compressed
usng script `data/convert/convert_xarray.py`. Some of them failed to load and may need to be converted using older version of xarray.
